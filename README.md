## My process
I made use Of basic html and external CSS linked together using the link tag. I begin the process by creating the basic html tag, starting with the basic head tag with the link tag linking to the external style sheet the meta tag as well as the title of the project. Moving over to the body tag a total of 2divs with classes container and card respectively the first div fills the background and the project is displayed on. The codes i used are well outlined in the stylesheet and the html document.
### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned
MAking this was very insightful for me it gave me better undrstanding of units (px vh e.t.c) and also positions, the use of favicons and also external fonts also I'm very glad i embarked on this project.


```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width initial-scale=1.0">
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="images\favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Outfit">
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: inline-flex;
}
```




### Continued development
I would lov to keep on developing myself in CSS and frontend designs and develop ways to make my work faster and more presentable to the users who'll be making use of the websites i develop. 

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts ](https://fonts.google.com) - This offered me various font options which makes my design more classic presentable. I will use more of it and explore other font options while i progress.
